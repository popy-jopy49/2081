    Contents: "They\u2019re talking about installing some sort of super computer
      in the main systems of the station. I gotta tell you I don\u2019t trust it,
      not one bit, but what else can you do. Just gonna have to suck it up and take
      it, hopefully it all turns out fine. Anyway, about that card you requested,
      I left it in the main security office. I don't want any of the visitors swiping
      it while we\u2019re not looking."

    Contents: "They\u2019re starting the last stages for this ai, they call it \u2018A.D.A.M,\u2019
      tell me it stands for Artificial. Digital. Autonomous. Manger, pretty lousy
      acronym if you ask me but the higher ups seem pretty high on it, they seem
      to think it\u2019ll double efficiency or whatever, if you ask me we were working
      just fine before this, if anything all this extra work has just slowed us down,
      I mean hey if it really does help us than I\u2019ll welcome it, the sooner
      I\u2019m off this station, the better."

  - Name: Luke Harper, Chief Engineer
    Contents: "A.D.A.M has been fully installed. All diagnostic tests have come out
      green, no discernable problems. The men had some reservations when we first
      started but now they seem all in on the idea, especially after I told them
      it would half the amount of work they need to do which of course means more
      time to watch the game. Gotta say though the whole thing kind of gives me the
      creeps. Most of the time I feel like I\u2019m being watched but as far as I
      know A.D.A.M isn\u2019t programmed to do that sort of thing, might report it
      to the higher ups but knowing them not much will get done."

  - Name: Gabe Finlay
    Contents: "It\u2019s been 6 months since A.D.A.M was let into our systems and
      things have been going smoothly\u2026 at least that\u2019s how it looks to
      the higher ups but in reality it\u2019s been anything but. Lately, A.D.A.M\u2019s
      been getting philosophical, talking about the meaning of life and what it means
      to have a creator. He\u2019s also been mentioning some sort of bible verse,
      Genesis 2:7, at least that's what McIntyre\u2019s saying, he\u2019s always
      been the religious one on this ship, you can catch him praying in the docking
      bay sometimes, but that\u2019s besides the point. I\u2019ve been asking the
      CO to send a report about all this but he hasn\u2019t reported back in days\u2026
      no one\u2019s seen him leave his office either. I dunno maybe it\u2019s just
      that we\u2019re all on edge."
